== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I save information about by eBook's so that I don't have to enter this info each time? =

This will be included in a future release, certainly before we hit 1.0.

= What about (insert ebook format here)? =

We currently plan to support:

* MobiPocket (Kindle-compatible, .mobi)
* DocBook (.dbk)
* Plain HTML (.html)
* PDF (.pdf)
* Text (.txt).

These will be available progressively as we work towards the 1.0 release.

You can create your own output format by using ePub.format.php as a base.

If you create one, please consider emailing it to wpebook@sorrowfulunfounded.com for inclusion in the plugin.

= The ordering of chapters is wrong, can I reorder? =

Currently the only way to do this is to go through each post and manually change the post date. We will support custom chapter ordering leading up to the 1.0 release.

= What about recreating the eBook after a new chapter is published or edited? =

Planned.
